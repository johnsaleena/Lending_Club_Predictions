# Lending_Club_Predictions
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the probability that a loan will charge off. We will attempt to only use data available to investors via the LendingClub loan listing, including information about the borrower (income, employment length, FICO score, debt-to-income ratio, etc.) and the loan listing (the loan amount, loan purpose, loan grade, interest rate, installment, etc.). Such a predictive model could help LendingClub investors make better-informed investment decisions. We will only consider loans that LendingClub accepted under its credit underwriting policy.
